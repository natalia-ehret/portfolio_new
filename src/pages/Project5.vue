    <h2>THE WHITE SEAGULLS ARE WHITE JUST SO</h2>
    <p>
      A year ago my son started being tested for autism and all that year, I
      have lived waiting for the exakt diagnosis. All this time, I have been
      watching him and asking myself: is it or isnâ€™t it? And if it is, what does
      it make for his future? In my film I tried to convey these my feelings and
      to reflect on how conventionally could be classification people into
      typical and atypical.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that a lot of neuro atypical people in the history of art or
      science have only enriched their society. Maybe it's time to talk about
      different neurotypes rather than the norm?
